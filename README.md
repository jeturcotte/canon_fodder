# canon_fodder
The idea here is to brainstorm, detail, and implement a data storage mechanism for fictional works in a way that offers testing of substories cast against them.

# concepts

# development
## stage 1...
* determine a markup language that canon scripts would run against
  * Needs to be human readable as well as script dissectable
  * Needs to be relatively easy to update
* determine an algorithm that can parse a 'suggestions' against the canon database
