During development of this software, I intend to hold on all rights except insofar as to allow collaboration, forking, even use by third parties.  My goal is simply to retain some semblance of control over what this idea turns into until it has legs.  Then I will revist that license.  In other words, FOR NOW, modifications will be governed a bit.
